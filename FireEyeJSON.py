    # for any given dictionary entry,
    # if it's value is another dictionary,
    #    then make it a list with that dictionary as the only value,
    #     then recurse through each value to make sure that this problem
    #        isn't recurring lower down
    # if its value is a list, then make a list in the new value,
    #     then walk each value in the list & recurse through the original
    #       list to make sure the values work
    # if it's just a base value (string, integer, float),
    #    then copy the value into the new dictionary.
    #
    # None of this would be necessary if fireeye would just be
    # consistent about their JSON
